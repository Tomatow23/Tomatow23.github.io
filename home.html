            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>Hello Everybody!
                I'm Nathan Dunn. I'm a Software Engineer with an Associates in Computer Science - Programming in Java and currently a senior at Northern
                Michigan University in Computer Science.<br><br> I have been interested in web design since I was 14 and started making small websites for fun. Eventually
                when it was time to go to school I decided to switch paths and focus more on the engineering aspect of programming where I began to compete in competitions
                and really grow myself as a developer.<br><br> This is where I decided computer science was my future. I then began an Internship at GE Healthcare and from there I began
                to learn a lot about medical equipment but more importantly the way to protect it from cyber attacks and our customers to best protect private information.
                Alongside this I had to learn how to manage very large amounts of data to accommodate each medical asset in
                our system due to it's large scale and best optimize our databases for data manipulation with a non-stop stream of new data.<br><br>
                During this time I competed in the ACM programming competition ending at rank 81. This was a huge accomplishment for me as I have never attended an ACM contest
                prior to that moment. 

                I am currently interested in going into a Software Engineering / Full-Stack Development role. I have experience in all major programming languages through my time at school but I am
                very familiar with Java and It's Spring framework specifically. I similarly know HTML, CSS and Javascript quite well as well as some of their frameworks.<br>
                <br>
                Thank you for reading about me if you have any questions please contact me at nathan.toma.dunn@gmail.com and I'll respond as quick as I can.
                <br>
                <br>
                Have a wonderful day,
                <br>

                Nathan Dunn.

                <p>The project is a movie ticket system that allows you to create a customer, a new movie and for a customer to checkout a movie and add all this to the SQL database</p>

                <p>This project was apart of a program where I was teaching new programmers how to use HTML, CSS and Javascript in a web application.</p>

                <p>This was around a 4 week project where we went from nothing to a simple project using javascript and some simple cookies to manipulate data.</p>
